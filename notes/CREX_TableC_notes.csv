1,"The operations specified by operator descriptors C 41 000, C 42 000 and C 43 000 remain defined until cancelled or until the end of the data subset. Regulation 95.3.4.2 shall not apply here."
2,"An event, as defined for use with operators C 41 000 and C 42 000, is a set of one or more circumstances described using appropriate Table B descriptors along with their corresponding data values. The grouping of such descriptors together as a single ""event"" allows them to be collectively assigned as the target of a separate descriptor such as B 33 045 or B 33 046. When defining a circumstance within an event, descriptor B 33 042 may be employed preceding the appropriate Table B descriptor in order to indicate that the corresponding value is actually a bound for a range of values."
3,"A categorical forecast value represents a ""best guess"" from among a set of related, and often mutually exclusive, data values or categories. Operator C 43 000 may be used to designate one or more values as being categorical forecast values, and descriptor B 33 042 may be employed preceding any such value in order to indicate that that value is actually a bound for a range of values."
